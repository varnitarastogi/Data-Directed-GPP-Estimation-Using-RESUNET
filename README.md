# GPP-ESTIMATION-USING-RESUNET
Gross Primary Productivity(GPP) is the measure of total carbon fixed by plants into the atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis. It depends on various climate variables such as precipitation, temperature , moisture in the soil and radiation energy from the sun. This project aimes to estimate GPP by finding non linear relationships between these variables and how they affect GPP over time.
