# GPP-ESTIMATION-USING-RESUNET
Gross Primary Productivity(GPP) is the measure of total carbon fixed by plants into the atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis. It depends on various climate variables such as precipitation, temperature , moisture in the soil and radiation energy from the sun. This project aims to estimate GPP by finding non linear relationships between these variables and how they affect GPP over time.

The data is in the form of iris cubes and has been taken from two Earth System Models- UK Earth System Modelling Project (UKESM) and Beijing Climate Center Earth System Model version 1 (BCC-ESM1).

## Architecture
The CNN is based on UNet architecture with Resblocks.
